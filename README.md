Project "Mishka" (adaptive layout) using HTML5, CSS3(Sass, BEM methodology), JS, Gulp.

There are some bugs related to using Gulp 3.9.x and Node v10 together, so I used Node 8.15.0 while developing the project.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run server with project
npm start

# create build for production
npm build
```
